  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
      <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improv this shit.</h1>
      <h3>7 fucking declarations</h3>
      <p>
        That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy to read masterpiece.
        It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><em>Still</em> looks the same on all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
      <p>
        You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.
      </p>
      <h1>Let it breathe</h1>
      <p>
        Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</br>
        </br>
        If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
      </p>
      <h1>A little less contrast</h1>
      <p>
        Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
      </p>
      <h1>Size matters</h1>
      <p>
        I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller types work well for print, not the screen.
